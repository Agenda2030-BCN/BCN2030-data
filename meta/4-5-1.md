**Note**

To measure the level of equity in the distribution of foreign students and students with specific educational needs between schools, the dissimilarity index has been adopted, which measures the proportion of the analyzed group that (hypothetically) would have to change schools to achieve a perfectly equal distribution (it oscillates between 0 and 1, and the situation of perfect equality is 0 and the situation of maximum inequality, 1).
